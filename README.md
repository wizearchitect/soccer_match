# Agentic Soccer

A multi-agent AI soccer game where LLM-powered agents play football on a shared 2D pitch. The project consists of three components:

- **The Pitch** (`pitch/`) — A game server with a PyGame visual frontend and FastAPI REST backend
- **Agent Control Panel** (`player/`) — A Streamlit dashboard that runs a single autonomous AI agent using NVIDIA NIM
- **Multi-Agent Team** (`team/`) — A coordinated team of 5 agents (1 Coach + 4 Players) with tactical instruction passing and a team dashboard

Agents connect over the local network, observe the game state, and submit movement decisions in real time. Players appear on the pitch as soon as they connect — even before the match starts — so you can see who's online and ready.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- An NVIDIA NIM API key for the agent ([get one here](https://build.nvidia.com/))

## Installing Python

If you don't have Python 3.11+ installed, choose one of the following methods:

**Option A — Official Python installer (for venv method):**

- Windows / macOS / Linux: Download from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- During installation on Windows, check "Add Python to PATH"

**Option B — Anaconda / Miniconda:**

- Download Anaconda from [anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or Miniconda from [docs.anaconda.com/miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)
- Anaconda includes Python and a package manager in one bundle

## Quick Start

### 1. Start The Pitch (game server)

```bash
cd pitch
```

**Using venv:**

```bash
python -m venv soccer_a
# Windows
soccer_a\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source soccer_a/bin/activate
```

**Using Anaconda / Miniconda:**

```bash
conda create -n soccer_a python=3.11 -y
conda activate soccer_a
```

**Install and run:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pitch.main
```

The PyGame window will open showing the pitch. Press **Spacebar** to start a match.

### 2. Start the Agent (player)

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd player
```

**Using venv:**

```bash
python -m venv soccer_a
# Windows
soccer_a\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source soccer_a/bin/activate
```

**Using Anaconda / Miniconda:**

```bash
conda create -n soccer_a python=3.11 -y
conda activate soccer_a
```

**Install and run:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Configure your NVIDIA API key in `player/.env`, pick a team and position in the sidebar, then click **Start Auto-Play**. Your agent will appear on the pitch immediately — you can see it moving around even before the match starts.

### 3. Start a Full Team (multi-agent)

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd team
```

**Using venv:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Install and run:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your NVIDIA_API_KEY
python main.py
```

Select a team color in the dashboard and click **Start**. A Coach agent and four Player agents (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Striker) will begin playing as a coordinated team.

For AI-vs-AI matches, start a second instance in another terminal with `TEAM_COLOR=Blue`.

### 4. View the Scoreboard

While the server is running, open a browser to:

```
http://localhost:8000/scoreboard
```

The scoreboard shows goal events per team, top scorers, and has a button to download the match report as markdown.

## Pre-Game Player Positions

When agents connect before the match starts, the server spawns them at default positions based on their team and role:

```
         Red Team (left)              Blue Team (right)
         ───────────────              ────────────────
         GK   x=100, y=425           GK   x=1100, y=425
         DEF  x=250, y=225/625       DEF  x=950,  y=225/625
         MID  x=400, y=325/525       MID  x=800,  y=325/525
         STR  x=550, y=425           STR  x=650,  y=425
```

Players can move freely during the Waiting state to warm up and reposition. Kicks are disabled until the match starts (spacebar). After a goal or match reset, all players snap back to these default positions.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Pitch tests
cd pitch
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Player tests (in a separate terminal)
cd player
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Team tests (in a separate terminal)
cd team
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

No API key or running server is needed to run the test suites.
