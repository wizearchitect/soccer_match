"""Player Agent module for the multi-agent soccer team.

Contains the PlayerAgent class that runs an independent Look-Think-Act loop
for a single player position. Each player reads shared game state, optionally
incorporates Coach instructions, invokes a lightweight LLM for decision-making,
and posts movement/kick actions to the Pitch server.
